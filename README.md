# ATM Simulation System

Nowadays, managing a bank is tedious job up to certain limit. With Internet Banking, the brick and mortar structure of the traditional banking gets converted into a click and portal model, thereby giving a concept of virtual banking a real shape. Hence a software that reduces the work is essential. Thus, considering above necessities, a software for managing all transactions has become necessary!

This application enables the customers to perform the basic banking transactions by sitting at their office or at homes through PC or laptop. The system provides the access to the customer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, also to view reports of all accounts present. This model can be easily integrated with any banking site/application to allow the customers to perform any transaction and keep track of them easily.
