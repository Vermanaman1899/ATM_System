# ATM Simulation System

Nowadays, managing a bank is tedious job up to certain limit. With Internet Banking, the brick and mortar structure of the traditional banking gets converted into a click and portal model, thereby giving a concept of virtual banking a real shape. Hence a software that reduces the work is essential. Thus, considering above necessities, a software for managing all transactions has become necessary!
